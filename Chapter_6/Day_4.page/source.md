## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * apply the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to find GCDs and LCMs,
    * apply the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to factorials, and
    * understand the application of the FTA to congruence equations.

## Preparation

* ðŸ’¾ We will somewhat cover [Section 6.4](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-fta-consequences.html) and [Section 6.5](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-application-primes-congruences.html). 
* ðŸ“– Some of this is in section 3.1 of Burton.
