## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * use the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd of two numbers, and 
    * prove even more properties of the gcd.

## Preparation

* 💾 You may browse [Section 2.3 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-euclid-alg.html). 
* 📖 You can look at section 2.4 of Burton, if you would like.
* ✍️ Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute \\(\\gcd(143,227)\\)
* 🎥 This YouTube video goes through an example of the Euclidean algorithm. We will do one in class together as well, so it's not a huge need that you look over this beforehand. They use a different format than I will use, but you might find it useful.
