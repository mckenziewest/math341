## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * use properties of the gcd to prove facts about divisibility, and 
    * use properties of the gcd to prove facts about relatively prime integers.

## Preparation

* 💾 You may browse [Section 3.7 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-two-gcd-facts.html). 
* 📖 The exercises for today come from section 2.4 of Burton.
* ✍️ Prove that if \\(\\gcd(a,b)=1\\) then \\(\\gcd(a+b,ab)=1\\) too.
* 🎥 This YouTube video includes a proof that if \\(F_n\\) represents the \\(n\\)-th Fibonacci number, then \\(\\gcd(F_n,F_{n+1})=1\\).
