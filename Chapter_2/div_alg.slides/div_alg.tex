	\exam{\textbf{Motivation from Historical Text.}
		
		From the \underline{Ganitasara Sangraha}, a text written by Mahaviracharya, a Jain mathematician in approximately 850 A.D.
		
		\begin{goldblock}
			There were 63 heaps of plantain fruit put together and 7 single fruits. They were equally distributed among 23 travelers leaving no remainder. What is one possible number of fruits in each pile?
		\end{goldblock}

}
\slide{
	\begin{block}{\textbf{Goal.}}
		Really we're trying to find positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that 
			\[63x+7=23y.\]
			
		Or, in the form we'll be using:
			\[-63x+23y=7.\]
	\end{block}
	\begin{nb}
		This is called a \emph{Diophantine equation} and we'll learn how to solve these next week.

	\begin{statementblock}{The Division Algorithm}
		Given integers $a$ and $b$ with $b>0$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying
			\[a=qb+r\quad 0\leq r<b.\]
		We call $q$ the \emph{quotient} and $r$ the \emph{remainder} in the division of $a$ by $b$
	\end{statementblock}
	\begin{statementblock}{Corollary}
		If $a$ and $b$ are integers with $b\neq 0$, then there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying
			\[a=qb+r\quad 0\leq r<|b|.\]
	\end{statementblock}
}
\slide{
	\begin{exercise}
		Let's take $b=-4$ and some $a$ values \blank{.25in}, \blank{.25in}, and \blank{.25in}.
		
		Then using the division algorithm, we have
		
		\[\blank{.25in}=\blank{.25in}\cdot(-4)+\blank{.25in}\]\vfill
		\[\blank{.25in}=\blank{.25in}\cdot(-4)+\blank{.25in}\]\vfill	
		\[\blank{.25in}=\blank{.25in}\cdot(-4)+\blank{.25in}\]
	\end{exercise}

	\begin{nb}
		The Division Algorithm allows us to classify integers into a finite number of cases for example \emph{even} ($2q+0$) and \emph{odd} ($2q+1$).
	\end{nb}
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that for all integers $a$, we have $a^2$ is either a multiple of 4 or one more than a multiple of 4.
	\end{exercise}
}
\slide{
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that for all integers $a$, if $a$ is odd then $a^2$ is of the form $8a+1$.
	\end{exercise}
}
\slide{
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that $\ds\frac{a(a^2+2)}{3}$ is an integer for all $a\in\Z$.
	\end{exercise}
}
\slide{
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that the cube of an integer is of the form $7k$ or $7k\pm 1$.
	\end{exercise}
}
\slide{
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that if an integer is simultaneously a square and a cube, then it must be of the form $7k$ or $7k+ 1$.
	\end{exercise}
}
\slide{
	\begin{defn}
		We say the integer $a$ is \emph{divisible} by the integer $b\neq 0$ if there is some integer $c$ such that $a=bc$. In this case, we write $b\mid a$.
		
		If $a$ is not divisible by $b$ then we write $b\nmid a$.
	\end{defn}

	\begin{nb}
		Divisibility corresponds to checking if $r=0$ in the division algorithm.
	\end{nb}

\slide{
	\begin{exercise}
		Show that in every sequence of 3 consecutive integers, one of the numbers is divisible by $3$.
