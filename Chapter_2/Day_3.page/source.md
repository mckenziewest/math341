## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * compute the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of a list of integers, and 
    * determine whether two integers are relatively prime.

## Preparation

* 💾 You may browse [Section 2.2 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-gcd.html). But this is a lot of the main content for the day. Remark 2.2.3 is neat.
* 📖 You can look at page 21 of Burton, if you would like. We will prove Theorem 2.3 as stated during class.
* ✍️ For \\(a\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(a\\neq 0\\), compute \\(\\gcd(a,a)\\), \\(\\gcd(a,0)\\), and \\(\\gcd(a,1)\\).
* 🎥 Here's a Youtube short. I include it because I haven't seen this way of finding a gcd before, and it looks cute.
