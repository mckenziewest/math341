## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * access Sage on the BluGold Super Computer, and
    * use the division algorithm.

## Preparation

* 💾 Definitely taking a look at [Section 2.1.1 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-div-alg.html#subsection-div-alg-statement). We'll get more into proofs and using the division algorithm later.
* 📖 You can look at Section 2.2 of Burton, but actually I'd recommend you do that for next time instead.
* ✍️ Practice using Sage as described in Section 2.1.1 of the online book to compute quotients and remainders.
* 🎥 Again, a "if you like videos" entry. In this video, the speaker proves the theorem that is the Division Algorithm.
