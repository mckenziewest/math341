## Purpose

  * Practice content from number theory, namely
      * proofs with the division algorithm, and
      * the Euclidean algorithm.
  * Build a strong foundation of creative critical thinking and proof-writing techniques.

## Task
  * Complete the exercises listed on the following page(s) of this document and submit your solutions by 4pm on the due date.
  * You may hand-write answers, or type your solutions using LaTeX.
  * You may work in groups but everyone should submit their own assignment written in their own words.  Do NOT simply copy your classmates.
    * Allowed resources: our textbook, classmates, your notes, videos linked in Canvas.
    * Unacceptable resources: anything you find on an internet search. Do NOT use a homework help website (e.g., Chegg). Their solutions are often wrong or use incorrect context.  I want you to practice making arguments that are yours. Take some ownership.
    * Do not use Chat GPT!

## Criteria
  * All short answer response questions in this assignment will be graded according to accuracy, use of full sentences, readability, and organization.
  * All proofs will be graded using similar criteria with the addition of correct use of definitions and known results.
