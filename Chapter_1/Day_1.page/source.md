## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * apply the definition of divisibility for integers, and
    * prove properties of divisibility of integers.

## Preparation
* I might recommend taking a look at [Section 1.2 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/first-review.html), specifically focusing on Definition 1.2.5, of divisibility.
* If you want to find divisibility in the physical textbook, look at Page 20.
* For some practice, try Section 2.3 Exercise 1 of the physical textbook.
* There's some optional reading here, [Section 1.1 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/first-prob.html).
  This covers a neat problem about "conductors" of two positive integers. 
  
  The *conductor* of \\(a\\) \\(b\\), if it exists, is the smallest positive integer \\(n\\) such that \\(n=ax+by\\) for some positive integers \\(x,y\\) such that for all \\(N>n\\) a similar representation exists, of \\(N=aX+bY\\) for positive integers \\(X,Y\\).
