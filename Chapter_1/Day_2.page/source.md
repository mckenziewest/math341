## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * use induction to prove properties of infinitely many integers.

## Preparation

* 💾 Definitely taking a look at [Section 1.2.2 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/first-review.html#subsection-induction), and more importantly at [Example 1.2.7](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/first-review.html#example-4-divides-5n-1).
* 📖 Section 1.1 of Burton discusses divisibility. You can optionally take a look at this to remind yourself of some basic examples.
* ✍️ For some practice, use induction to show that \\(n^2+n\\) is divisible by 2 for all integers \\(n\\geq 1\\). (You can also do it without induction, but give it a try with induction.)
* 🎥 If you like videos, take a look at
