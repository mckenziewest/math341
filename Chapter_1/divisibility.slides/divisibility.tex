	\begin{defn}
		The integer $d$ \emph{divides} the integer $n$ if there is some integer $k$ for which
			$$dk=n.$$
			
		In this case, we write \emph{$d|n$} to mean 
		\begin{center}
			``$d$ divides $n$'' or
			 ``$n$ is divisible by $d$'' or ``$d$ is a divisor of $n$.
		\end{center}
		The statement \emph{$d\nmid n$} means that ``$d$ does not divide $n$''.

		For integers $a,b,c$, and $d$, the following hold
		\enumalph{ 
			\item $a|0$, $1|a$, $a|a$.
			\item $a|1$ if and only if $a=\pm 1$.
			\item If $a|b$ and $c|d$, then $ac|bd$.
			\item If $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a|c$.
			\item $a|b$ and $b|a$ if and only if $|a|=|b|$.
			\item If $a|b$ and $b\neq 0$, then $|a|\leq |b|$.
			\item If $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(bx+cy)$ for all integers $x$ and $y$.

		A \emph{conditional statement} is a statement that can be written in the form ``If $P$ then $Q$'' where $P$ and $Q$ are also statements, called the \emph{hypothesis} and \emph{conclusion}, respectively.
