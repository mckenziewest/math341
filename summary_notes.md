# Math 341 Summary Notes

## Course Logistics

This is a 3 credit 14 week course that meets for 50 minutes 3 times a week.

There are two days during the semester where class will be cancelled for conference and travel purposes.

In Spring 2023, there are 6 students in the course.

The content for this course follows the structure of [Number Theory: In Context and Interactive](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/) as it is available in 2023. 

## Intended Audience for Course

The prerequisite for Math 341 at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire is Calculus 1. 
However, in the semester that these notes are being generated in this manner, all students have taken at least either Linear Algebra or Discrete Math, both of which serve as intro to proof courses at UWEC.
Therefore, there is some assumption as to proof-writing abilities.

## Course Progress Relative to Content
### Introduction (3 days)
* The order of the slides for these days needs updating.
* There is one set of slides in here, [What_Is_NT](Introduction/introduction.slides/What_Is_NT.tex). And two sets of worksheets, [day_2](Introduction/day_2.file/day_2.tex) and [day_3](Introduction/day_2.file/day_3.tex).
* The first day, after going through the syllabus, I got through the "Typical questions in Number Theory" content. I might rearrange this all in the future.
* Day two, I decided I didn't like talking to much, so rather than blabber on about a bunch of conjectures, I immediately handed out the 
[day_2](Introduction/day_2.file/day_2.tex) worksheet and had the students work in pairs. The intention of the multiple versions was to have students finish the hour by presenting what they found for their conjecture on Page 2.
    * This would be a good opportunity to show students some cool Sage things, like how to list all the primes.
* Day three, we started by reminding ourselves of the content covered on day 2. Then we jumped into [day_3](Introduction/day_2.file/day_3.tex), which we completed as a group together. 

### Chapter 1 (2 days)
* My focus for this chapter is to re-introduce the basics of proof using the tool of divisibility. 
* The content for these days is
    * Slides: [divisibility](Chapter_1/divisibility.slides/divisibility.tex)
    * Worksheet: [Induction_ws](Chapter_1/Induction_ws.file/Induction_ws.tex)
* Day 1: Complete content up to induction (hopefully)
* Day 2: Start with induction examples in slides then pass out worksheet. Again, this worksheet has 3 version so potentially groups could present.

### Chapter 2 (4-5 days)
* Division Algorithm, GCD, Euclidean Algorithm,  Aryabhata's Kuttaka Method
* Content
    * Python Notebook: [Division_Algorithm_Sage](Chapter_2/div_alg_notebook.file/Division_Algorithm_Sage.ipynb)
    * Slides: [Proofs using division algorithm](Chapter_2/div_alg.slides/div_alg.tex)
    * Slides: [GCD and properties](Chapter_2/gcd.slides/gcd.tex)
    * (TODO) Slides: Euclidean Algorithm
    * (TODO) Worksheet: Aryabhata's Kuttaka Method
    * (TODO) Slides/Worksheet...? for day 5?
* Day 1: Teach students how to generate Sage notebooks and how to use them.
* Day 2: Complete division algorithm content by proving facts using the division algorithm.
* Day 3: Define GCD and cover related content, complete associated slides.
* Day 4: Explain Euclidean Algorithm and how it is used for Aryabhata. (Worksheet)
* Day 5: Wrap up Chapter with some more gcd facts.
