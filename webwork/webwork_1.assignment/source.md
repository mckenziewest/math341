This particular WeBWorK assignment relates to our introduction to number theory
content that we covered during the first week of class. 

This will introduce you to the topics of perfect/abundant/deficient numbers as
well as to the famous Collatz conjecture.

In the future, assignments will more directly correspond to the content covered during class. 
However, for this introduction, I just want to expose you to a wide variety of 
number theory topics.
