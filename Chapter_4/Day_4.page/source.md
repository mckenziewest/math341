## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * fast exponentiation, and 
    * representations of integers in binary number system.

## Preparation

* ðŸ’¾ Today we will cover topics like those in [Section 4.5](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-why-mod-matters.html) of the online textbook.
* ðŸ“– You can look at Section 4.3 of Burton as well.
* ðŸŽ¥ A good video discussing fast exponentiation
