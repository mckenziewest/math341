	\begin{defn}
		\emph{Pure mathematics} is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics.

		\begin{statementblock}{Conjecture (Fermat, c.~1637) Theorem (Wiles, 1995)}
			The equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$ has no non-trivial integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ if $n\geq 3$.
		\end{statementblock}
		\begin{proof}[Proof Idea]
			\enumalph{
				\item \textbf{Fact:} The general equation for FLT is elliptic.
				\item \textbf{Taniyama--Shimura--Weil (TSW) Conjecture, 1967:} Each rational elliptic curve is also a modular form.
				\item \textbf{Frey's Conjecture, 1986:} Any counterexample to FLT would also imply that a semistable elliptic curve existed that was not modular.
				\item \textbf{Ribet, 1990:} Frey's conjecture holds.
				\item \textbf{Wiles, 1995:} Wiles proves TSW's conjecture holds.
