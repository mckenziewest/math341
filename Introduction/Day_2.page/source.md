## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * recognize and explore some standard questions of number theory.


**NOTE:** The preparation here today is even more examples to add to what we will talk about in class.

## Practice 

Consider the function \\(f(z)=z^2-1\\). Following the method of repeated evaluation as in the video, what happens when \\(z=0,-1,1,2\\)?

After you watch the video and complete the practice exercise, take a look at the Introduction section of Silverman's
[2010 AWS notes](https://swc-math.github.io/aws/2010/2010SilvermanNotes.pdf). Specifically focus on the definitions before example 1 and at example 2.

If you are familiar with 'mod', Example 1 refers to \\(\mathbb{F}_{11}=\\{0,1,2,\\dots,10\\}\\) where every operation is taken modulo 11.  We'll talk about this sort of stuff later on in the semester!
