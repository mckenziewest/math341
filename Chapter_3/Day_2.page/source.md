## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * solve diophantine linear equations given restrictions on the solutions.

## Preparation

* 💾 We will primarily cover [Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-lin-geom.html). Give it a peak if you want to get a feel for what we will cover in class.
* 📖 You can look at the final example in Section 2.5 of Burton, about solving a real-world diophantine equation problem.
* ✍️ Determine all solutions in the positive integers of the following Diophantine equation \\(18x+5y=48\\).
* 🎥 This is the same video I posted on [the last daily summary](page:📚 Linear Diophantine Equations). It's worth posting again.
