## Outcomes

* After class time today you will be able to
    * recognize the meaning of "solving a diophantine equation", and
    * solve diophantine linear equations.

## Preparation

* 💾 We will primarily cover [Section 3.1 of the online book](https://math.gordon.edu/ntic/ntic/section-lin-dioph.html). Give it a peak if you want to get a feel for what we will cover in class.
* 📖 You can look at Section 2.5 of Burton as well.
* ✍️ Section 2.5 Exercise 1 from Burton.  Which of the following Diophantine equations can be solved?
  <ol>
    <li> \\(6x+51y=22\\) </li>
    <li> \\(33x+14y=115\\) </li>
    <li> \\(14x+35y=93\\) </li>
  </ol>  
* 🎥 This is a really cool video that I recommend watching.
